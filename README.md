# Lists_Cycles

To demonstrate the activity life cycle to students. The steps are as follows:

1- Students pull the project and open it through android studio
2-  Students are asked to track the toast messages as they browse through the app and write down their observations.
3- Studetns are asked to change orientation many times and observe the toast messages (What do they observe)?
4- The students then are asked to find a way to stop the activity from calling onCreate again when the orientation changes.
5- A final question: Why do they think activity life cycle is important?
6- Students are requested to explore the fragment life cycle on their own.
