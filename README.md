# Lists_Cycles

To demonstrate the activity life cycle to students. The steps are as follows:

1- Students pull the project and open it through android studio

2-  Students are asked to track the toast messages as they browse through the app and write down their observations.

3- Students are asked to change orientation many times and observe the toast messages (What do they observe)?  
3-a check orientation change with list 1
3-b check orientation change with list 2 (is there a difference)   - click the button and then do the orientation
3-c go to home, go back, switch-apps view

4- The students then are asked to find a way to stop the activity from calling onCreate again when the orientation changes.

5- A final question: Why do they think activity life cycle is important?



6- Students are requested to explore the fragment life cycle on their own.
